# Fountains

Advanced water transportation using fountains, intakes, valves, and pipes.

## Fountains

A dispenser pointing up can be configured as a fountain. Fountains can create water columns up to 10 blocks high.

## Intakes

A hopper can be configured as an intake. Intakes suck water in from above them and create water buckets that can be transported using other hoppers or pipes.

## Valves

A redstone lamp can be configured as a valve. Valves allow water through when they are activated with redstone.

## Sprinklers

A dispenser pointing down can be configured as a sprinkler. Sprinklers will spray water particles in a circle from 1 to 6 blocks in radius.

## Pipes

Cobblestone walls connected together become pipes when they are connected to an intake. Pipes supply water to fountains, and flow can be stopped with valves.
